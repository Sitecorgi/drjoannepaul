16:30 - 18:30
3 April 2022 

*The Stables, [Kenilworth Castle](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Kenilworth+Castle+and+Elizabethan+Garden/@52.3482119,-1.594296,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x4870caa0c07a9bcf:0x98323fb970c1502c!8m2!3d52.3482086!4d-1.5921073?shorturl=1)* 

Join us in the stunning setting of Kenilworth Castle for a panel with historian Dr Joanne Paul, author of The House of Dudley; and novelist Natasha Solomons, author of I, Mona Lisa in discussion with bookseller and historian Tamsin Rosewell. We’ll be discussing everything from the power of art, to the power of a monarch’s favour – and also looking at how we write and read history, from having a narrative voice for non-fiction, to creating a ‘voice’ for a famous painting and allowing them to tell their version of history.
