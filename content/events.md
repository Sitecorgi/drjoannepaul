#### [Historian's Guide to the Coronation](https://roundtable.org/class/course/a-historians-guide-to-the-coronation)

Online event: 5pm  \
27 April 2023\
\
This short masterclass will introduce participants to the ceremony, symbolism, and history of the coronation, by way of 1000+ years of English history. From the Normans, Plantagenets, Tudors and Stuarts, and into the more "modern" Hanoverians and Windsors, the coronation has developed and changed, while some of its ancient roots remain. The coronation is thus a powerful symbol of Britain itself and a perfect vehicle for exploring its history.

This is the history of British coronations you won’t get on the TV.

Online course\
16 May - 20 June, 4:00 - 5:00 PM\

Over five weeks, Dr. Paul will explore the richness of the Tudor period—from Henry VII to Elizabeth I, from the Renaissance to the Reformation, and from the battlefields of France to the lavish banquet tables of Henry VIII, ushering in a new state religion and confirmation of the distinctly English culture that would have world-wide repercussions for centuries, all with the devious Dudleys as their guide.

#### [The House of Dudley](https://cathedral.southwark.anglican.org/whats-on/the-house-of-dudley-a-new-history-of-tudor-england-a-talk-by-dr-joanne-paul/)

Southwark Cathedral\
6:30pm, 2 Nov 2023\
Library

Here, for the first time, is the story of England's Borgias, a noble house competing in the murderous game of musical chairs around the English throne. Witness cunning, adultery and sheer audacity from history's most brilliant, bold and skulduggerous family.

This event will take place in the Cathedral library and will be in-person only and not streamed or recorded.

Doors will open at 6.15pm and copies of The House of Dudley: A New History of Tudor England will be available to purchase on the evening.

Book tickets [here](https://cathedral.southwark.anglican.org/whats-on/the-house-of-dudley-a-new-history-of-tudor-england-a-talk-by-dr-joanne-paul/).
