      <h3>COUNSEL AND COMMAND IN EARLY MODERN ENGLISH THOUGHT</h3>
      <p>
        While it has often been recognised that counsel formed an essential part
        of political discourse in early modern England, the precise role that it
        occupied in the development of political thinking has remained obscure.
        This comprehensive and rigorous study of early modern English political
        counsel established the importance of the relationship between political
        counsel and the discourse of sovereignty. Tracing the changes and
        evolution of writings on poltiical counsel during the 'monarchy of
        counsel', from the end of thw Wars of the Roses to the end of the
        English Civil War, Joanne Paul examines English thought in its domestic
        and transnational context, providing an original account of the
        relationship between counsel and emerging conceptions of sovereignty.
        Formed a the conjunction of the history of political thought and English
        poltiical history, this book grounds textual analysis within the context
        of court politics, intellectual and patronage networks, and diplomacy.
